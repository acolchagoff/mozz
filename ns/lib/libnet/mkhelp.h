Because this information is accessed by a javascript   context sometime after the URL is delivered to the window, we needed a persistent   way in which the data would remain associated with a given window, and,   despite a great desire to not muck around with the MWContext, that was the   only thing that was in scope at the time.  Lou Montoulli suggested using   fields that are part of the URL_struct, such as the fe_data and Chrome   fields, but these were not in scope at the time that the Javascript calls   were being evaluated. */typedef struct HelpInfoStruct_ {	char		*topicURL;	char		*projectURL;} HelpInfoStruct;#define HELP_INFO_PTR(MW_CTX)		((HelpInfoStruct *) (MW_CTX).pHelpInfo)/* Called by netlib to parse a nethelp URL.
