Mozilla for PPC Macs running System 7 (Eventually 68k Macs too?)

Heres the src after I've rearranged everything to be more mac centric, and fixed a bug that stopped Navigator from launching without a Type 12 error.

The build.sit file contains a built copy

The CW Dropins.sit file contains support files necessary to make Codewarrior 2 Pro have the appropriate support files.

a complete setup process for codewarrior is documented here: http://andrew.colchagoff.com/netscape/macbuild/

Do not try this with Codewarrior 3 pro!!! you have been warned.
