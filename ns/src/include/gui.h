This is the                  string sent along with the vendor ID string, so it should be                  of the form "1.1N (Windows)" or "1.1N (X11; SunOS 4.1.3)".  XP_AppLanguage  The language of the navigator client.  Usually a two-letter                  code (EN, FR) but could be a 5-letter code for translations                  where a sub-language designation is appropriate (FR_CA)  XP_AppPlatform  The compiled flavor of the navigator (as opposed to what                   it may actually be running on). */XP_BEGIN_PROTOS#if defined(XP_WIN) || defined(XP_OS2)extern char *XP_AppName, *XP_AppCodeName, *XP_AppVersion;extern char *XP_AppLanguage, *XP_AppPlatform;#elseextern const char *XP_AppName, *XP_AppCodeName, *XP_AppVersion;extern const char *XP_AppLanguage, *XP_AppPlatform;#endifXP_END_PROTOS/* this define is needed for error message efficiency * * please don't comment it out for UNIX - LJM *//* this is constant across languages - do NOT localize it */#define XP_CANONICAL_CLIENT_NAME "Netscape"/* name of the program *//* XP_LOCAL_CLIENT_NAME was never used consistently: use XP_AppName instead. */#endif /* _GUI_H_ */
