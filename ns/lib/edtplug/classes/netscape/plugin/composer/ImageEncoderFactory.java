That class is instantiated, and it's getImageEncoders method * is called. This method is responsible for creating and returning an enumerator of * ImageEncoders. * * <p>Most developers don't need to use this class -- they can simply use the * "netscape.plugin.composer.ImageEncoder.classes" property to name their * ImageEncoder classes * directly. However, the ImageEncoderFactory class provides additional flexability. Some * possible uses of a ImageEncoderFactory class include: * <ol><li>A wrapper for another application's image encoders. The wrapper would * search the other application's data base, find the other application's image encoders, * and synthasize ImageEncoder instances that wrapped the other application's * image encoders. * <li>A remote repository of image encoders that's searched at run time. * </ol> */public class ImageEncoderFactory {    /** If you have a default constructor, it must be public, or else you class cannot be     * instantiated by name.
