In the preferences dialog and in the mail filters dialogfor example. Carriage returns end up rendering the files used by these dialogsunreadable by the parserInherits from LGAEditField so it has a gray scale appearance---------------------------------------<< ¥ >>----------------------------------------*/#pragma once#include "SearchHelpers.h"class CSingleLineEditField : public CSearchEditField {	public:			enum	{ class_ID = 'sLEF' };									CSingleLineEditField (LStream* inStream);		virtual				~CSingleLineEditField ();		};
