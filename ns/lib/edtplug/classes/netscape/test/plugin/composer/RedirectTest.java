I have a public * web site that is updated via ftp rather than http. * This means that the browsing URL is different than the * editing URL. For example, my main page has browsing URL * *     http://www.palevich.com/index.html * * and an editing URL of: * *     ftp://palevich@shell3.ba.best.com/users/u1/palevich/public_html/index.html * * The plug-in works by changing request to edit pages from my web site * into requests to edit pages from my ftp site. * * The plug-in is registered as an event handler. It handles the "edit" event. * * Note: The URLs given in this example may not work in the future, * since I may change ISPs, or my current ISP may change its machine * names. * * In order to be useful, you would substitute your own URLs. * (Since you don't have my password, you won't be able to save * your changes to my web pages, anyway.) * */public class RedirectTest extends Plugin {    static public void main(String[] args) {        Test.perform(args, new RedirectTest());    }    // Since this is an event handler, we don't need to override the    // UI methods GetName, GetCategory, or GetHint.    public boolean perform(Document document){        String event = document.getEventName();        URL url = document.getDocumentURL();        System.err.println("RedirectTest: event " + event + " url:" + url);        // Only do something if this is an edit event.        // and we have a non-empty document URL.        if ( event != null && "edit".equals(event) && url != null ){            // Does the URL start with the old prefix?            String urlAsString = url.toString();            if ( urlAsString.startsWith(oldPrefix) ){                // Create a new URL string that has the new prefix and                // the remainder of the old URL.                String newURL = newPrefix + url.toString().substring(oldPrefix.length());                // My ISP's http: server will automatically                // send the index.html file if the URL ends in a "/".                // However, the Navigator FTP client will display a directory for                // an FTP URL that ends in a "/".
