These panes are always positionedappropriately to be in line with their columns.  The panes are resized horizontally totouch the left and right edges of their columns.The class also supports special appearance for the sorted column, chosen by clicking on a column header.The header does NOT scroll.  Columns are always resized proportionally, though columnscan be marked as fixed width. The header's image size always matches its frame.¥ CreationThe view has custom PPob and also requires a 'Cols' resource.  The data in the PPobspecifies the following information:	header flags:						only 1, kHeaderCanHideColumns		2 bevel trait resource ids:		sorted column header, then unsorted			reverse modifiers:		an event record modifier mask that denotes a reverse-sort selection			'Cols' resource ID:			id of 'Cols' resource, with column initialization data, REQUIRED			The 'Cols' resource is used to initialize the size and positioning of the header's columns.  The header of the resource (SavedHeaderState) is defined in LTableHeader.h.Following the header is an array of ColumnData (also in LTableHeader.h) records, 1 for each column.The header of the resource specifies:			# of columns						(1-based)		index of rightmost visible column	(1-based)		index of sorted column				(1-based, 0 if none)				Each ColumnData record specifies:		Pane ID of column header, 0 if none				Column Width			In pixels if fixed size, in % of non-fixed space if resizable					Column Position 			Meaningless in saved state, ignore it.					ColumnFlags			kColumnDoesNotSort and/or kColumnDoesNotResize		¥ Header and Column Size		If a column is fixed-width, it will always have that width. Widths of resizable 	columns are maintained as percentages of the non-fixed space in the header.		When a column is resized, all columns to its right resize proportionally.  	¥ Hiding/Showing Columns		If the kHeaderCanHideColumns flag is set in the header flags, the view will have	a widget at the right edge for hiding and showing columns.	¥ Dragging/Resizing Columns	To change the rgn that gets dragged when resizing or moving a column, override	ComputeResizeDragRect or ComputeColumnDragRect respectively.	¥ Sorting	When the sorted column changes, LTableHeader broadcasts a msg_SortedColumnChanged	message, with TableHeaderSortChange parameter.		The method GetSortedColumn returns both the index and the header pane ID of the	sorted column.						---- LTableViewHeader ----LTableViewHeader is a subclass of LTableHeader that coordinates changes in the headerwith an LTableView.  When columns are hidden or shown in the header, this class removes/adds columns from/to the table view.  When the image size of the header changes, the image size of the table is adjusted as well. When columns are redrawn in the header, they are invalidated for refresh in the table view.This class also overrides ComputeResizeDragRect and ComputeColumnDragRect to create moreuseful regions when dragging and resizing columns.---- LTableRowSelector ----This subclass of LTableSelector selects entire rows.  Individual cells cannot be selected.It allows multiple selection and supports that standard shift and command key selection extension semantics.---- LFlexTableGeometry	----This subclass of LTableGeometry works in concert with an LTableHeader to compute the positionof cells in a table.  All rows are of uniform height, and column positions and widthsare determined by querying the associated LTableHeader view.---- Using them together	----The Dogbert mail window will use these classes all together.  A subclass of LTableView(CMessageTableView)  sets its geometry to LFlexTableGeometry, and its selector toLTableRowSelector.When drawing a cell, CMessageTableView queries its associate LTableViewHeader to find thepane ID of the column's header.  The pane ID's denote which element of the row is drawn in that cell.  For instance, a column with header 'subj' contains the message subject. Thisindirection allows the column order to be changed.
