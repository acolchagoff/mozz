The   states are as follows:   NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT        If this is defined, then all line breaks in the input cause line        breaks in the output as well.  If it is not defined, then single        newlines in the input are considered to be simple whitespace, and        a blank line (that is, two consecutive line breaks) is needed to        break a paragraph.   HACK_PREFIX        If this is defined, then lines beginning with ">" will be treated        specially.   NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && !HACK_PREFIX        In this state, all lines which are longer than the fill column will        be wrapped, and all other lines will be left alone.   NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && HACK_PREFIX        In this state, all lines which are longer than the fill column will        be wrapped unless they begin with ">" in the first column.  Lines which        are shorter than the fill column, or lines which begin with ">", will        be left alone.   !NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && !HACK_PREFIX        In this state, all paragraphs will be re-wrapped to the fill column,        regardless of where the line breaks were in the input.  A blank line        delimits a paragraph.   !NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && HACK_PREFIX        In this state, all paragraphs will be re-wrapped to the fill column,        regardless of where the line breaks were in the input.  A blank line        delimits a paragraph.        Fill prefixes on paragraphs are recognised, if they begin with ">"        followed by any number of >'s or whitespace, and the paragraphs will        be re-filled using that prefix.        Paragraphs are delimited by blank lines, or by changes in the prefix        sequence.        NOTE: The code for this state is not yet fully debugged.  The current plan is that, when the user generates a mail or news message, we  will use a text editor which does display-time wrapping of lines; and then,  when the time comes to send the message, we will wrap it to a fill column  equal to the width of the user's window.  In this way, we will (hopefully)  insert newlines in the text in the same places where the text editor had  wrapped them for display: what the user saw on the screen is what the person  at the other end will see as well.  However, this has the drawback that no line will ever be longer than the  fill column, even when that would be better.  A common situation is this:  = The user cites a message; this causes the message to be inserted in their    editor with a "> " prefix on each line.  = If a line was 79 columns in the original text, it will now be 81 columns.  = That means that the text editor will wrap the line: it will look something    like this:            > This is a body of text that was just shorter than            the            > fill column, and is now just longer than it.  Which            causes            > the text to be displayed with alternating long and            short            > lines, which is extremely unpleasant.    Now, if the user resized their window to be 81 columns wide instead of 80,    that text would look "normal" again; but there are two problems with this,    the first and most obvious being that most people aren't going to do that,    and the second being that that would cause the user's new text to be    filled to 81 columns as well, which would be a bad thing.  = So, a good approach to solving this problem would be to re-fill the cited    text before inserting it in the text area, to ensure that no line is longer    than 79 columns after the prefix has been added; and then, when the user    sends the message, to wrap the lines as display did.    This would mean applying (!NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && HACK_PREFIX) to the    cited text, and then applying (NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && !HACK_PREFIX)    to the outgoing text.  = However, I couldn't get the (!NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && HACK_PREFIX)     state to work well enough.  Which is the reason for the existance of the    (NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT && HACK_PREFIX) state.  the current plan is this:    = The user cites a message; this causes the message to be inserted in their      editor with a "> " prefix on each line.    = Some lines may be wider than the window, causing the display to wrap      them unattractively.    = When the user sends the message, we insert newlines in the text at the      same places where the display would have wrapped the lines, *except*       that we don't touch lines which begin with ">".  So, our line wrapping      is WYSIWYG for new text, but not for cited text, which is passed through      unaltered.    I think this should do the right thing most of the time.  Problems:    = This will mess up on lines/paragraphs which just happen to begin with ">"      as their first character.  That could cause us to send extremely long      lines.  This should be pretty rare, howeveer.    = It is possible that the user might edit a message which *looked* like it      had a paragraph with ">" at the beginning of each line, but that really      didn't contain any newlines at all; the implicit line wrapping done by      display might be all that there is.  This also seems pretty unlikely.    = It's fairly important that the algorithm implemented by this code be the      same as the algorithm used in redisplay by the various text editors.  This code is pretty tough to read because of all the ifdefs; once we're  really sure how it all should work, we should rip out the unused states,  or live with duplicated code. */#define NEWLINES_ARE_SIGNIFICANT#define HACK_PREFIX#undef DEBUG_WRAP/* Oops, what was I thinking.
