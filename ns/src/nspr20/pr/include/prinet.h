On *       Unix, socket support is scattered in several header files, *       while Windows and Mac have a "get-everything" socket header *       file. *     - NSPR needs the following macro definitions and function *       prototype declarations from these header files: *           AF_INET *           INADDR_ANY, INADDR_LOOPBACK, INADDR_BROADCAST *           ntohl(), ntohs(), htonl(), ntons(). *       NSPR does not define its own versions of these macros and *       functions.  It simply uses the native versions, which have *       the same names on all supported platforms. *     This file is intended to be included by nspr20 public header *     files, such as prio.h.  One should not include this file directly. */#ifndef prinet_h__#define prinet_h__#if defined(XP_UNIX) || defined(XP_OS2)#include <sys/types.h>#include <sys/socket.h>		/* AF_INET */#include <netinet/in.h>         /* INADDR_ANY, ..., ntohl(), ... */#ifdef XP_OS2#include <sys/ioctl.h>#else#include <arpa/inet.h>#endif#include <netdb.h>#if defined(FREEBSD) || defined(BSDI)#include <rpc/types.h> /* the only place that defines INADDR_LOOPBACK */#endif/* * OS/2 hack.
