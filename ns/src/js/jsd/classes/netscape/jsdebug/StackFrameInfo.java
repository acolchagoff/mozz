However, multiple threads and* exceptions are relevant to JavaScript as well because of its* interoperation with Java.** @author  John Bandhauer* @author  Nick Thompson* @version 1.0* @since   1.0*/public abstract class StackFrameInfo {    ThreadStateBase threadState;    StackFrameInfo caller;    protected StackFrameInfo(ThreadStateBase threadState) {        this.threadState = threadState;    }    /**     * Return true if this stack frame is still valid.
