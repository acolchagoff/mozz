We do not need to make		sure the output stream do not have partial characters. Therefore, we could		ignore the unconverted buffer and never use it. We always treat the 		stream in a byte oriented way.	*/MODULE_PRIVATE unsigned char *mz_euckr2iso(	CCCDataObject		obj,			const unsigned char	*eucbuf,	/* EUC buffer for conversion	*/			int32				eucbufsz)	/* EUC buffer size in bytes		*/{ 	char unsigned			*tobuf = NULL; 	int32					tobufsz; 	register unsigned char	*tobufp, *eucp;		/* current byte in bufs	*/ 	register unsigned char	*tobufep, *eucep;	/* end of buffers		*/ 	/* Allocate a dest buffer:	 * ISO2022 would be at worst 3 times that of EUC	 */	tobufsz = eucbufsz * 3 + 8;	if ((tobuf = (unsigned char *)XP_ALLOC(tobufsz)) == (unsigned char *)NULL) {		INTL_SetCCCRetval(obj, MK_OUT_OF_MEMORY);		return(NULL);	} 	tobufp = tobuf; 	tobufep = tobufp + tobufsz - 2;		/* save space for terminating null */ 	eucp = (unsigned char *)eucbuf; 	eucep = (unsigned char *)eucbuf + eucbufsz - 1;	/* save space for nul */	if (!IsIns5601_87_ESC(obj))	{		Ins5601_87_ESC(tobufp, obj);		*tobufp++ = (unsigned char)CR;				*tobufp++ = (unsigned char)NL;	}	while ((tobufp <= tobufep) && (eucp <= eucep))	{		if (*eucp & 0x80) {			if (IsIns5601_87_SI(obj))				Ins5601_87_SO(tobufp, obj);			*tobufp++ = *eucp++ & 0x7f;		} 		else {			if(IsIns5601_87_SO(obj))				Ins5601_87_SI(tobufp, obj);			*tobufp++ = *eucp++;		}	}	*tobufp =  '\0';						/* null terminate dest. data */	INTL_SetCCCLen(obj,  tobufp - tobuf);			/* length not counting null	*/	return(tobuf);}
