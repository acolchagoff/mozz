The js/ref directory contains standalone ANSI-C source for the NetscapeJavaScript Reference implementation, JSRef, which is licensed to over 160companies.The js/src directory contains source files listed in the file "commfiles",that are derived via prconv.sed from counterparts in the js/ref directory.It also contains files such as jsjava.c that are not in js/ref yet.  TheMakefile in js/src has refconv and refdiff targets to help keep js/ref andjs/src in synch.If you think you need to change a file listed in commfiles here, please letus know by mailing jsengteam first.Brendan Eich (brendan), 12-Nov-97
