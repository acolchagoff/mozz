The alternative for structures is to use tags, * which are named the same as their typedef names (legal in C/C++, and less * noisy than suffixing the typedef name with "Struct" or "Str").  Instead, * all .h files that include this file may use the same typedef name, whether * declaring a pointer to struct type, or defining a member of struct type. * * A few fundamental scalar types are defined here too.  Neither the scalar * nor the struct typedefs should change much, therefore the nearly-global * make dependency induced by this file should not prove painful. *//* Scalar typedefs. */typedef uint8  jsbytecode;typedef uint8  jssrcnote;typedef int32  jsrefcount;typedef uint32 jsatomid;/* Struct typedefs. */typedef struct JSCodeGenerator  JSCodeGenerator;typedef struct JSGCThing        JSGCThing;typedef struct JSToken          JSToken;typedef struct JSTokenStream    JSTokenStream;/* Friend "Advanced API" typedefs. */typedef struct JSAtom           JSAtom;typedef struct JSAtomList       JSAtomList;typedef struct JSAtomMap        JSAtomMap;typedef struct JSAtomState      JSAtomState;typedef struct JSCodeSpec       JSCodeSpec;typedef struct JSPrinter        JSPrinter;typedef struct JSProperty       JSProperty;typedef struct JSRegExp         JSRegExp;typedef struct JSRegExpStatics  JSRegExpStatics;typedef struct JSScope          JSScope;typedef struct JSScopeOps       JSScopeOps;typedef struct JSStackFrame     JSStackFrame;typedef struct JSSubString      JSSubString;typedef struct JSSymbol         JSSymbol;typedef struct JSSharpObjectMap JSSharpObjectMap;#endif /* jsprvtd_h___ */
