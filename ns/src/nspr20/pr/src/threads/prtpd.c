It's largish, so it is intended to be a sanity check, not** an impediment.**** There is a counter, initialized to zero and incremented every time a** client asks for a new key, that holds the high water mark for keys. All** threads logically have the same high water mark and are permitted to** ask for TPD up to that key value.**** The vector to hold the TPD are allocated when PR_SetThreadPrivate() is** called. The size of the vector will be some value greater than or equal** to the current high water mark. Each thread has its own TPD length and** vector.**** Threads that get private data for keys they have not set (or perhaps** don't even exist for that thread) get a NULL return. If the key is** beyond the high water mark, an error will be returned.*/#define _PR_TPD_MODULO 8                /* vectors are extended by this much */#define _PR_TPD_LIMIT 128               /* arbitary limit on the TPD slots */static PRUintn _pr_tpd_highwater = 0;   /* next TPD key to be assigned */static PRUintn _pr_tpd_length = 0;      /* current length of destructor vector */PRThreadPrivateDTOR *_pr_tpd_destructors = NULL;                                        /* the destructors are associated with                                            the keys, therefore asserting that                                            the TPD key depicts the data's 'type' *//* Lock protecting the index assignment of per-thread-private data table */#ifdef _PR_NO_PREEMPT#define _PR_NEW_LOCK_TPINDEX()#define _PR_FREE_LOCK_TPINDEX()#define _PR_LOCK_TPINDEX()#define _PR_UNLOCK_TPINDEX()#else#ifdef _PR_LOCAL_THREADS_ONLY#define _PR_NEW_LOCK_TPINDEX()#define _PR_FREE_LOCK_TPINDEX()#define _PR_LOCK_TPINDEX() _PR_INTSOFF(_is)#define _PR_UNLOCK_TPINDEX() _PR_INTSON(_is)#elsestatic PRLock *_pr_threadPrivateIndexLock;#define _PR_NEW_LOCK_TPINDEX() (_pr_threadPrivateIndexLock = PR_NewLock())#define _PR_FREE_LOCK_TPINDEX() (PR_DestroyLock(_pr_threadPrivateIndexLock))#define _PR_LOCK_TPINDEX() PR_Lock(_pr_threadPrivateIndexLock)#define _PR_UNLOCK_TPINDEX() PR_Unlock(_pr_threadPrivateIndexLock)#endif#endif/*** Initialize the thread private data manipulation*/void _PR_InitTPD(){	_PR_NEW_LOCK_TPINDEX();}/*** Clean up the thread private data manipulation*/void _PR_CleanupTPD(void){	_PR_FREE_LOCK_TPINDEX();}/*** This routine returns a new index for per-thread-private data table. ** The index is visible to all threads within a process.
