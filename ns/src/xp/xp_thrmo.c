If this is unknown, it should be 0.					Note that if four documents are in progress, and					the sizes of three are known and the size of one is					unknown, then the total_bytes should be 0, since					a single unknown makes the total unknown.    bytes_received	How many bytes have been read so far.  If total_bytes					is non-0, and this is larger than total_bytes, then					there is a bug.    start_time_secs	The time at which the transfer started, in seconds.    now_secs		The current time, in seconds.  The 0-point of these					values is uninteresting, only the relationship between					The two.  It would be fine for start_time_secs to 					always be 0, and now_secs to be the number of seconds					since the transfer began.  Returns: a statically allocated string, or NULL. NULL is returned in  out-of-memory conditions, or when there is nothing to say (as would  happen early in the transfer, if all values were 0.) DO NOT FREE THE  RETURNED STRING.  The caller is responsible for freeing the returned string. */const char*XP_ProgressText( unsigned long total_bytes,				 unsigned long bytes_received,				 unsigned long start_time_secs,				 unsigned long now_secs ){	/* This is all fairly hairy, but generating sensible human-readable text	 always is.
